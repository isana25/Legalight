# **Legalight: AI-Powered Legal Document Summarizer**

⚖️ **Legalight: Your AI Ally for Safer Agreements**  
**Know Before You Agree — Because Fine Print Shouldn't Be a Trap**

---

## 🚀 **Use Case**
Legal documents are everywhere, from app Terms & Conditions to employment contracts and lease agreements. Yet most people never read them due to their length, complexity, and legal jargon. This leads to:

- 📜 Accidental agreement to hidden terms
- 💸 Unexpected penalties and auto-renewals
- 🔒 Unaware data-sharing or privacy breaches

**Legalight** solves this by using Generative AI to help users understand, summarize, and question any legal document in seconds — directly within this notebook.

## 💡 **What Makes It Unique?**
Unlike static document analysis, **Legalight** transforms legal content into a dynamic conversation using:

- **Structured outputs (JSON Mode)** — for easy-to-read and actionable insights.
- **Document summarization & clause extraction** — to distill long documents into key points.
- **Risk level classification** — helps assess the level of risk within the document.
- **Vector search & embeddings** — for accurate, context-aware responses using advanced semantic search.

This AI-powered assistant makes legal language understandable for everyone, from individuals to small business owners.
